The image currently crashes, but can serve as starting point for future
development if/when the riscv32 system call UABI stabilizes and a C library
is available.

The root file systems in this directory are built with v4.19 linux headers.
Since the system call ABI for riscv32 in the Linux kernel changed several
times subsequently, init crashes with -ENOSYS when using those headers.
The problem is probably related to linux kernel upstream commits 67314ec7b025
("RISC-V: Request newstat syscalls") and/or 27f8899d6002 ("riscv: add
asm/unistd.h UAPI header").

Root file systems built with v4.20 or v5.0 kernel headers don't crash,
but hang during boot. Booting with init=bin/sh suggests that a poll system
call may be missing.

Root file systems can not be built with more recent (5.1 and later) linux
headers due to glibc build failures. This is primarily due to linux
upstream commit d4c08b9776b3 ("riscv: Use latest system call ABI"), which
removed the define of __ARCH_WANT_TIME32_SYSCALLS and with it the define
of __NR_futex, which in turn is required by the version of glibc for
riscv32 used by buildroot 2019.05.1. A more recent version of glibc for
riscv32 does not appear to be available as of this writing.
