n800/n810 (omap2420)
--------------------

Use omap2plus_defconfig.

Run:

qemu-system-arm -M n800 -kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage \
	-monitor none -nographic \
	-serial /dev/null -serial /dev/null -serial stdio \
	--append "console=ttyS2 earlycon" \
	-dtb arch/arm/boot/dts/omap2420-n800.dtb

It will start but crash with
	Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] SMP ARM
and also generate a lot of backtraces.


spitz and related
-----------------

Flash probe fails with

physmap-flash physmap-flash: physmap platform flash device: [mem 0x00000000-0x007fffff]
physmap-flash physmap-flash: map_probe failed

This is because the ROM is at address 0, and the root file system
starts at offset 0x00140000. The qemu spitz code supports the
address range, but allocates it as ROM at address 0, and doesn't
support attaching a file to it.

There is a NAND flash at PXA_CS3_PHYS (0x0c000000), to be instantiated
with IF_MTD. Instantiating it requires CONFIG_MTD_RAW_NAND=y and
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_SHARPSL=y, but that only results in "bad erase block"
and uncorrectable ECC errors. The problem is seen even with old kernel
versions and with old versions of qemu, so it doesn't look like it was
introduced recently.

collie
------

Collie supports flash, but it doesn't instantiate. do_map_probe()
from the Linux kernel returns an error, and pflash trace is inconclusive.
